# rock-paper-scissors

## game-console.html
A simple JavaScript implementation of the schoolyard classic, currently for use in the console. Plays to five rounds.

Access the HTML page [here](https://petrichor829.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/game-console.html).

Bonus feature: The <code>prompt()</code> does not accept weapons outside the "rock" || "paper" || "scissors" parameter. If you come to this fight with a banana (really?!), the app will prompt you to try again.

## game-ui.html
A (refactored) version of the above. First to five points wins. Each round's results are displayed in a JavaScript-generated table.
