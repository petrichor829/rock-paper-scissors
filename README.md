# rock-paper-scissors
A simple JavaScript implementation of the schoolyard classic, currently for use in the console.

Bonus feature: The <code>prompt()</code> does not accept weapons outside the "rock" || "paper" || "scissors" parameter. If you come to this fight with a banana (really?!), the app will prompt you to try again.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)
